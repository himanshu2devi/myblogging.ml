                            </br></br><p style="font-size: 15px">  Our memories are what we are,the way we act ,the way we think,the way we make decisions .We would be nothing without without memories!The most important part of memory is emotion or emotion it brings.All memories ðŸ’­ðŸ’­ðŸ’­carry with them one or more associated emotions.The powerful emotions like happiness,sadness,anger,nostalgia last in our memory.From these emotions we learn how to act in future..these experiences that help us to take decisions in future and act accordingly.Our memory is very selective ,and the learnings we draw from our memories weigh more heavy than the memory itself.So if we are happy, in future we cherish these happy moments but if something happens that makes us sad we always face difficulty accepting things and we are not comfortable with those sad memories.So we make efforts to get beautiful memories to flutter through the great hall of our memory again.</p>

                                                       <p style="font-size: 15px;">Its impossible for a human to remember everything.Our brain tends to remember only those things that make us too happy, too sad or if we are told by someone to remember it,or if someone makes a particular moment worth remembering.Good memories are those people often talk about but people avoid talking about painful memories with a fear that people with judge them.If we consider example of a small child or even think about ourselves when we were kid we all have knowingly or unknowingly  touched  a hot vessel and ever since we wouldn't do the same mistake because we have experienced the physical pain caused to us.The hand is safe because we immediately pull it back but that pain remains in our heart forever as a painful experience and we will definitely be careful next time when such situation occurs.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px;">Pain is good for us.Yes,you have read it right ! Pain is good for us because we tend to learn ,grow ,become more strong .We have always heard elders at our home saying" humare baal aise hi safed nahi hue hai" its because most of the things we think to do they have gone through it and they know where we " may" stuck  its not that we will get stuck but there are chances that we may get stuck.Also most people think maturaity comes with age but I dont believe that.I feel maturity comes with experience .A person in tender age may also go through a lot of pain and sufferings and therefore may havea  better maturity level than a person with more age.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px;">The localisation of pain and how it is percieved reveals a lot about pain.Pain can be physical or emotional acute or chronic. Indeed,any injury or serious disease creates painful emotions for the patient."Where does it hurt?" is the most common question asked.Acute pain can be treated but chronic pain with no apparent cause,are difficult to heal.Memories are one of the type and chronic condition can lead to depression.So,its better we create sweet memories and learn from our mistakes and have strong willpower to let go pain which isnt physically visible and try finding out solution on it.Memories are the most beautiful asset one can posses!  </p>
